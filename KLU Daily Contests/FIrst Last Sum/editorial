In the given problem, you are given a number N and you need to print the sum of its first and last digits.
Approach
we can get the last digit of the number N by doing N%10.

we can get the first digit of the number N by repeatedly dividing N by 10 until n becomes less than 10.

Print the sum of first digit and last digit.




Pseudo Code

Read t;
for i from [0,t-1]:
    Read n;
    last = n%10;
    first = n
    while first >= 10:
        first = first/10
    print(first + last)

 
Time Complexity



Time Complexity   :  O(n* (len(s) + len(t)))

Space Complexity : O(len(s) + len(t))
