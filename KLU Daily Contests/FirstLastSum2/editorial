In the given problem, you are given a number N and you need to print the sum of its first and last digits.
Approach
If you pay attention to the constraints length of the number can be up to 103.
Let us see a few numbers and their lengths


   Number            Length
      1000                    3
      105                       6
      10100  - 1            100
      101000 - 1          1000

So a number with a length of 1000 can be up to 101000-1 and we can't store this big number in int or long long variable.
We need to read the number as a string and convert the first digit and last digit to int and add them and print them.

Pseudo Code

num=input()
n = len(num)
first = int(num[0])
last = int(num[n-1])

string num;
cin >> num;
int n = num.size();
int first = num[0]-'0';
int last = num[n-1]-'0';

String num = sc.next();
int n = num.length();
int first = num.charAt(0) -'0';
int last = num.charAt(n-1) - '0;


Read t;
for i from [0,t-1]:
    string s;
    read s;
    n = s.size();
    first = s[0] - '0';
    last = s[n-1] - '0';
    print(first+last)
