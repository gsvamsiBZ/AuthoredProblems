Read R and C 
Run an outer loop from 1 to R, to iterate through rows.
Run an inner loop from 1 to C, to iterate through columns.
Inside inner loop print "0" for first and last row or column cells, and for all other cells print space.
print a new line after inner loop.

Read t;
for i from [0,t-1]:
    Read R, C;
    for i from [1, R]:
        for j from [1, C]:
            if (i == 1 or i == R or j == 1 or j == C):
                print("0")
            else:
                print(" ")
        print("\n")
    print("\n")
